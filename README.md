# QUESTION

You need to build a model to predict user churn for a subscription-based service. How would you model user behavior and usage patterns to predict when a user is likely to cancel their subscription? What machine learning algorithms and techniques would you use to build this model?

# CHURN PREDICTION

Churn prediction is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving your company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with your product.

To predict churn effectively, youâ€™ll want to synthesize and utilize key indicators defined by your team to signal when a customer has a probability of churning so that your company can take action. Here are some steps to achieve this

> `Gather data`: Collect data on user behavior, usage patterns, and any other relevant factors that could impact churn, such as demographics or customer support interactions.

> `Define churn`: Determine what actions by users indicate churn. For a subscription-based service, this could be the cancellation of a subscription or a lapse in payment.

> `Feature engineering`: Engineer features that capture the user behavior and usage patterns that are most predictive of churn. These could include metrics like the frequency of logins, usage patterns, time spent on the platform, and engagement with specific features.

> `Algorithm selection`: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task. Classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are well-suited to predicting churn.

## Example of how the schema model should look like

Building a model and schema for predicting user churn in a subscription-based service requires a specific set of data and analysis which may include:

**Data Collection**:

> `User demographics` (age, gender, location, etc.)
> `Subscription` type (monthly, annual, etc.)
> `Subscription` status (active, canceled, lapsed)
> `Subscription` start and end dates
> `User activity on the platform` (frequency of logins, time spent on the platform, features used, etc.)
> `Customer support interactions` (number of tickets submitted, time taken to resolve, etc.)

**Schema**:

Once the data has been collected, the next step is to create a schema to store and manage the data. Here's an example of the schema:

> `Users table`: This table would contain user data, including demographics and subscription information.

> `Subscriptions table`: This table would contain subscription data, including subscription type, start and end dates, and status (active, canceled, lapsed).

> `Usage table`: This table would contain user activity data, including login frequency, time spent on the platform, and engagement with specific features.

> `Customer support table`: This table would contain data on customer support interactions, including number of tickets submitted, time taken to resolve, and satisfaction ratings.
